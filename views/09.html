<!--

Note 1: Angular 1.3 is added as well as a additional JavaScript tag.
Note 2: We have added a countdown timer to execute the search results after 5 seconds.
Note 3: The rest of the code is identical (including userdetails08.html).

1) Open script09.js and locate the countdown functionality.
2) How would you prevent the countdown from firing?
3) How would you add additional time to the countdown?
