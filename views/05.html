<!--

Note 1: Angular 1.3 is added as well as a additional JavaScript tag.
Note 2: We have now added an error message and replaced First and Last Name fields with Name, Location and the Avatar coming from Github instead of my blog.

1) Open script05.js and we will make modifications there.
2) Look at the form and note that we are using ng-submit and passing it a name. Look at the sample below for an alternative way of doig this.
3) Which method is best to use and why?
