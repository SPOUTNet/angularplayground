<!--

Note 1: Angular 1.3 is added as well as a additional JavaScript tag.
Note 2: We have extracted a lot of code to make the page more readable. What was removed from 07.html?

1) Open script08.js.
2) Examine the ng-include div tag and open the userdetails08.html file.
3) Why do we have to specify ng-show="user"? What if we tried something else?
