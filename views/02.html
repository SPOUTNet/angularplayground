<!--

Note 1: Angular 1.3 is added as well as a additional JavaScript tag.
Note 2: ng-app now has a name and is added to the html tag instead of the body.

1) Open script02.js and we will discuss it.
2) Notice the ng-controller name matches what we declared in script02.js. Controllers are used for scoping in Angular.
3) Besides message.length, what else can you do? ex. message.toLocaleUpperCase()
